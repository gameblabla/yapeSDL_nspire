Yape for TI Nspire CX

Here's Yape, a Plus/4 & C16 emulator for TI Nspire CX !
I recommend to overclock your calc if you want to run it faster.
D64 images files are not supported, sorry for that.

As the controls are not totally properly mapped,
some games may not be playable.

To play your games, add these lines to your ndless.cfg.tns :
ext.prg=yape
ext.tap=yape

Put the yape.tns file somewhere then simply start your game
by clicking on it (or pressing Enter).
